Introduction to Conditionals & Logic

To have a condition, we need relational operators:

== equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

Here are some of the major concepts:

An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
if / else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
We can add more conditions using else if statements.
Relational operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != can compare two values.
A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
