A variable represents a particular piece of your computerâ€™s memory that has been set aside for you to use to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

C++ basic data types include:
int: integers
double: floating-point numbers
char: individual characters
string: sequence of characters
bool: true/false

Single equal sign = indicates assignment, not equality in the mathematical sense.

cin is how to receive input from the user.
